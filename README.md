# 📰 Fake News Detection Web App - Elevvo NLP Internship

This is a clean and interactive **Fake News Detector App** built with **Streamlit**.  
It classifies news articles as either **Fake** or **Real**.

Three models are implemented and selectable within the UI:
- **Logistic Regression (TF-IDF based)**
- **Support Vector Machine (TF-IDF based)**
- **LSTM Neural Network (Deep Learning)**

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Clean and lemmatize text input using NLTK  
✅ TF-IDF-based classification (LogReg and SVM)  
✅ LSTM-based deep learning model with Keras  
✅ Displays predicted **label** and **confidence** (when available)  
✅ Beautiful and intuitive **Streamlit UI**  
✅ Word Clouds and Frequency Analysis included in the notebook  
✅ Full pipeline from data to deployment

## 📓 Notebook Workflow

> [`Elevvo_NLP_Internship_Task3.ipynb`](./Elevvo_NLP_Internship_Task3.ipynb)

Includes:
- Custom combined dataset from `Fake.csv` and `True.csv` (Kaggle)
- Text preprocessing: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords, lemmatization
- TF-IDF vectorization (for LogReg and SVM)
- Sequence tokenization & padding (for LSTM)
- LSTM model training and saving
- Classification reports and confusion matrices
- WordClouds and bar charts per class
- Final evaluation and summary of results

## ⚠️ Final Remarks

Despite exploring multiple models and tuning their architectures, a consistent number of misclassifications persisted — especially on articles with neutral or technical tone. Even the LSTM model, built using a top-rated Kaggle architecture, struggled to generalize on certain real-world examples. This highlights the need for richer embeddings and better datasets for real production use.
